                I am a Sophomore in the College of Engineering at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. 
                I am apart of a unique degree program that allows me to explore computer science, computer engineering, and software engineering core topics, giving me a wide range of skills and talents. 
                With a high interest in embedded and electrical systems, I am involved with the PrISUm Solar Car team at Iowa State University to learn and apply those topics using industry standards.
                These resources have allowed me to INNOVATE at Iowa State!
